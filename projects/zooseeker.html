      <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Provide a means of allowing zoo visitors to keep track of the exhibits
          that they want to see during their trip
        </li>
        <li>
          Generate optimized routes to take visitors through each of their
          selected exhibits in as little time as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          Create visual displays of the qualitative results on each page to
          summarize found identity
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Primary User Interfaces</strong></p>
      <p>
        The following user interfaces, whose functions are outlined below, were
        constructed using Android Studio. While the implementation details of
        each cannot be expanded upon due to academic integrity concerns, both
        user interfaces rely on frontends composed primarily of HTML-like tags
        and CSS-like styling, as well as backends that utilize calls to a local
        database to store and retrieve user data, as well as those of the zoo's
        exhibits. The optimized directions found in the second figure below are
        generated according to a recursive, greedy graph traversal algorithm
        that charts every possible route between two exhibits and returns the
        one with the lowest weight.
